# `fooBar` Function

This function loops from 0 to 100 and prints conditional values based on the numbers it encounters. It is a classic implementation of the FizzBuzz problem, but with the words "Foo" and "Bar."

## Description

The `fooBar()` function:

- Prints "FooBar" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
- Prints "Foo" for numbers divisible only by 3.
- Prints "Bar" for numbers divisible only by 5.
- Prints the number itself for other numbers.

## How to Run

You can run the function by simply calling it in your JavaScript code:

```javascript
fooBar();
